    <h1><b>Alpheidae</b></h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Alpheidae</b> (also known as the snapping shrimp, pistol shrimp, or alpheid shrimp) is a family within the shrimp infraorder Caridea characterized by having asymmetrical claws, the larger of which is typically capable of producing a loud snapping sound.</p>
    <p>The family is diverse and worldwide in distribution, consisting of about 1,119 species within 38 or more genera.[1] The two most prominent genera are Alpheus and Synalpheus, with species numbering well over 330 and 160, respectively.[2] Most snapping shrimp dig burrows and are common inhabitants of coral reefs, submerged seagrass flats, and oyster reefs. While most genera and species are found in tropical and temperate coastal and marine waters, Betaeus inhabits cold seas and Potamalpheops has a cosmopolitan distribution including being found in freshwater caves in Mexico.</p>
    <p>When in colonies, the snapping shrimp can interfere with sonar and underwater communication. The shrimp are considered a major source of sound in the ocean.[3]</p>

    <p>Snapping shrimp grow to 3–5 cm (1.2–2.0 in) in length. Its disproportionately large claw, larger than half the shrimp's body, is a dismorphic addition to the arsenal of the shrimp. The claw can be on either arm of the body, and unlike most shrimp claws, does not have typical pincers at the end. Rather, it has a pistol-like feature made of two parts. A joint allows the "hammer" part to move backward into a right-angled position. When released, it snaps into the other part of the claw, emitting an enormously powerful wave of bubbles capable of stunning larger fish and breaking small glass jars.[4]</p>
    <p>The claw snaps to create a cavitation bubble that generates acoustic pressures up to 80 kilopascals (12 psi) at a distance of 4 cm from the claw. As it ejects from the claw, the bubble reaches speeds of 25 m/s (90 km/h; 56 mph).[5] The pressure is high enough to kill small fish.[6] It corresponds to a peak pressure level of 218 decibels relative to one micropascal (dB re 1 μPa), equivalent to a zero to peak source level of 190 dB re 1 μPa m. Au and Banks measured peak-to-peak source levels between 185 and 190 dB re 1 μPa m, depending on the size of the claw.[7] Similar values are reported by Ferguson and Cleary.[8] The duration of the click is less than 1 millisecond.</p>
    <p>The snap can also produce sonoluminescence from the collapsing cavitation bubble. As it collapses, the cavitation bubble emits a short flash of light with a broad spectrum. If the light were of thermal origin, a temperature of the emitter over 5,000 K (4,700 °C) would be required.[9] In comparison, the surface temperature of the Sun is estimated to be around 5,772 K (5,500 °C).[10] The light is of lower intensity than the light produced by typical sonoluminescence, and is not visible to the naked eye. It is most likely a byproduct of the shock wave with no biological significance. However, this was the first known instance of an animal producing light by this effect. Subsequently, another group of crustaceans, the mantis shrimp, has been discovered to contain species whose club-like forelimbs can strike so quickly and with such force as to induce sonoluminescent cavitation bubbles upon impact.[11]</p>
