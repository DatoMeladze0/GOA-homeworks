    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML 
    (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]</p>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.</p>
    <h2>Style sheet</h2>
    <p>A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.</p>
    <h2>Selector</h2>
    <p>In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.</p>
    <h4>selector types</h4>
    <p>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID may only be applied to a single element.</p>
    <h4>Pseudo-classes</h4>
    <p>Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree.</p>
    <h4>Combinators</h4>
    <p>Multiple simple selectors may be joined using combinators to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof.[8] The order of the selectors is important.</p>
