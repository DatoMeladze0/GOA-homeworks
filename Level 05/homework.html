    <h1>Immersion (virtual reality)</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p>In virtual reality (VR), immersion is the perception of being physically present in a non-physical world. The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other stimuli that provide an engrossing total environment.</p>

    <h2>Etymology <button>[ edit ]</button></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The name is a metaphoric use of the experience of submersion applied to representation, fiction or simulation. Immersion can also be defined as the state of consciousness where a "visitor" (Maurice Benayoun) or "immersant" (Char Davies) has their awareness of their physical self transformed by being surrounded in an artificial environment. The term is used to describe partial or complete suspension of disbelief, enabling action or reaction to stimulations encountered in a virtual or artistic environment. The greater the suspension of disbelief, the greater the degree of presence achieved.</p>

    <h2>Types <button>[ edit ]</button></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>According to Ernest W. Adams,[2] immersion can be separated into three main categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tactical immersion: Tactical immersion is experienced when performing tactile operations that involve skill. Players feel "in the zone" while perfecting actions that result in success.</li>
        <li>Strategic immersion: Strategic immersion is more cerebral, and is associated with mental challenge. Chess players experience strategic immersion when choosing a correct solution among a broad array of possibilities.</li>
        <li>Narrative immersion: Narrative immersion occurs when players become invested in a story, and is similar to what is experienced while reading a book or watching a movie.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Staffan Björk and Jussi Holopainen, in Patterns In Game Design,[3] divide immersion into similar categories, but call them sensory-motoric immersion, cognitive immersion and emotional immersion, respectively. In addition to these, they add a new category: spatial immersion, which occurs when a player feels the simulated world is perceptually convincing. The player feels that he or she is really "there" and that a simulated world looks and feels "real".</p>

    <h2>Presence <button>[ edit ]</button></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Presence, a term derived from the shortening of the original "telepresence", is a phenomenon enabling people to interact with and feel connected to the world outside their physical bodies via technology. It is defined as a person's subjective sensation of being there in a scene depicted by a medium, usually virtual in nature.[4]</p>
    <p>Most designers focus on the technology used to create a high-fidelity virtual environment; however, the human factors involved in achieving a state of presence must be taken into account as well. It is the subjective perception, although generated by and/or filtered through human-made technology, that ultimately determines the successful attainment of presence.[5]</p>
    <p>Virtual reality glasses can produce a visceral feeling of being in a simulated world, a form of spatial immersion called Presence. According to Oculus VR, the technology requirements to achieve this visceral reaction are low-latency and precise tracking of movements.[6][7][8]</p>
    <p>Michael Abrash gave a talk on VR at Steam Dev Days in 2014.[9] According to the VR research team at Valve, all of the following are needed to establish presence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A wide field of view (80 degrees or better)</li>
        <li>Adequate resolution (1080p or better)</li>
        <li>Low pixel persistence (3 ms or less)</li>
        <li>A high enough refresh rate (>60 Hz, 95 Hz is enough but less may be adequate)</li>
        <li>Global display where all pixels are illuminated simultaneously (rolling display may work with eye tracking.)</li>
        <li>Optics (at most two lenses per eye with trade-offs, ideal optics not practical using current technology)</li>
        <li>Optical calibration</li>
        <li>Rock-solid tracking – translation with millimeter accuracy or better, orientation with quarter degree accuracy or better, and volume of 1.5 meter or more on a side</li>
        <li>Low latency (20 ms motion to last photon, 25 ms may be good enough)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Immersive media and technology <button>[ edit ]</button></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Immersive media is a term applied to a group of concepts,[10] variously defined, which may have application in fields such as engineering, media, healthcare, education and retail.[11] Concepts included in immersive media are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Virtual reality (VR)[12][10]</li>
        <li>Augmented reality (AR)[12][10]</li>
        <li>Mixed reality (MR)[12][10]</li>
        <li>Extended reality (XR)[12]</li>
        <li>Metaverse[12]</li>
        <li>Spatial computing[citation needed]</li>
        <li>3D content[12]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Technology <button>[ edit ]</button></p>
    <p>Immersive virtual reality is a technology that aims to completely immerse the user inside the computer generated world, giving the impression to the user that they have "stepped inside" the synthetic world.[13] This is achieved by either using the technologies of Head-Mounted Display(HMD) or multiple projections. HMD allows VR to be projected right in front of the eyes and allows users to focus on it without any distraction.[14] The earliest attempts at developing immersive technology date back to the 1800s. Without these early attempts, the world of immersive technology would never have reached its advanced technological state we have today. The many elements that surround the realm of immersive technology all come together in different ways to create different types of immersive technology including virtual reality and pervasive gaming.[15] While immersive technology has already had an immense impact on our world, its progressive growth and development will continue to make lasting impacts among our technological culture.</p>
